 * The second function maps an interface index into its corresponding
 * name.
 *
 *    #include <net/if.h>
 *
 *    char  *if_indextoname(unsigned int ifindex, char *ifname);
 *
 * The ifname argument must point to a buffer of at least IF_NAMESIZE
 * bytes into which the interface name corresponding to the specified
 * index is returned.  (IF_NAMESIZE is also defined in <net/if.h> and
 * its value includes a terminating null byte at the end of the
 * interface name.) This pointer is also the return value of the
 * function.  If there is no interface corresponding to the specified
 * index, NULL is returned, and errno is set to ENXIO, if there was a
 * system error (such as running out of memory), if_indextoname returns
 * NULL and errno would be set to the proper value (e.g., ENOMEM).
